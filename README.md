## Could Haves

- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Filter for outdoor seating
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Loading state
- [ ] Error state

## Notes before coding:

- This is for lunch, so possibly hard-code search for restaurants that are currently open? Or provide a toggle for 'open now' or 'lunch spots only'
- Don't make your API key public ðŸ˜…
- Favorites: local storage? Adding authentication feels out of scope for this type of project
